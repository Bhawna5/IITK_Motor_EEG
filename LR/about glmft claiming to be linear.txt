GLMFIT Fit a generalized linear model.
%   B = GLMFIT(X,Y,DISTR) fits a generalized linear model using the
%   predictor matrix X, response Y, and distribution DISTR.  The result B
%   is a vector of coefficient estimates.  Acceptable values for DISTR are
%   'normal', 'binomial', 'poisson', 'gamma', and 'inverse gaussian'.  The
%   distribution is fit using the canonical link corresponding to DISTR.
%
%   X is a matrix with rows corresponding to observations, and columns to
%   predictor variables.  GLMFIT automatically includes a constant term in the
%   model (do not enter a column of ones directly into X).  Y is a vector of
%   response values.  If DISTR is 'binomial' Y may a binary vector indicating
%   success/failure, and the total number of trials is taken to be 1 for all
%   observations.  If DISTR is 'binomial', Y may also be a two column matrix,
%   the first column containing the number of successes for each observation,
%   and the second containing the total number of trials.
