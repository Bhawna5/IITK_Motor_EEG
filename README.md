# Motor Imagery EEG signal Classification on DWT and Crosscorrelated signal features
Implemented and compared some of the prominently used classication algorithms and feature extraction techniques to classify a two class Motor imagery based EEG data with high accuracies. Identified a combination of algorithms that outperformed other procedures in effectively classifying the dataset.
